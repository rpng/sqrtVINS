Welcome to the ${\sqrt{VINS}}$ project! This repository provides the first open-source implementation of a robust and efficient square-root filter (SRF)-based visual-inertial navigation system (VINS). Extended from [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins), unlike conventional EKF- or MSCKF-based systems, ${\sqrt{VINS}}$ leverages a novel LLT-based SRF update to preserve the triangular structure of the covariance matrix, ensuring numerical stability, guaranteed positive semi-definiteness, and efficient memory usage. This makes it especially well-suited for embedded robotic platforms and systems constrained by limited precision.

Key highlights of ${\sqrt{VINS}}$ include:

âš¡ Ultra-fast and stable filtering â€“ runs efficiently wih 32-bit single-precision on embedded hardware (e.g., Jetson Nano in 5W mode with single thread (<1 GHz CPU)).

ðŸ§® Cholesky (LLT)-based SRF update â€“ fully exploits system structure to achieve significant speedups over canonical SRFs.

ðŸš€ Dynamic initialization â€“ recovers minimal states without triangulating 3D features, enabling reliable startup even in extreme conditions (as small as a 100 ms time window).

## Dependence
* ROS
* Eigen
* OpenCV

## Getting Started
### Run in Native System with EurocMav Dataset (Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS1 as Example)
```shell
# Step 1: Create the workspace
mkdir -p sqrt_vins_ws/src && cd sqrt_vins_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/rpng/sqrtVINS.git

# Step 2: Build 
catkin build

# Step 3: Download eurocmav rosbag(https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) in $HOME/datasets/euroc_mav or change the path in /ov_srvins/launch/serial.launch accordingly

# Step 4: Run the launch file
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ov_srvins serial.launch
```

### Docker Support
As the code base is extended from [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins), the dockcer support can refer to OpenVINS's [doc](https://docs.openvins.com/dev-docker.html).
